# The Challenge
I decided to go with React since it is easier to write components with it and make this as 
accessible as I could.
Basically my idea was to make a carousel that could support not only 3 and 6 objects but as many as required.
That is why made a "totalImages" prop. One can easily pass in a number and have the carousel buttons 
adapt dynamically to it. 

For passing in the images I created a dummy objects array that had basically an image and an alt tag.

Although carousels by nature are not very accessible I tried to make it as accessible as I could.
I tried to keep best practices in mind by:
1. Giving a play/pause button option
2. Keeping animations to 5 seconds
3. Clearly giving aria to buttons and turned the carousel in to a section so I could explain what
content is being displayed
4. I chose not to hide the images from the screen readers and instead chose to give it detailed
alt tags. (The tags in this case are dummy filled) The reason I did this was because during a 
user test with a blind woman, she pointed out that she felt much more included when the images
are described for her instead of having them blocked off.





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
